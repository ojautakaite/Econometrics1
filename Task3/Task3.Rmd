```
Use R for Fun!

install.packages('fun')

```{r}
library(fun)
if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") x11() else x11(type = "Xlib")
mine_sweeper()
```

```{r}
library(fun)
gomoku()
```

You can take a look at the list of functions in this package by reading the HTML help page (go to help.start()), and I also need to mention the demos, e.g. see demo('TurtleGraphics') for a demo of Turtle graphics (how many people know the old Logo programming language?), and demo(package = 'fun') for a list of all demos in this package.

```{r}
demo('RealTurtle', package = 'fun')
```
